## CSPro Prebuilt Libraries

This repository contains prebuilt external libraries for building the [Census and Survey Processing System](https://www.census.gov/data/software/cspro.html) (CSPro) and [CSEntry Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.census.cspro.csentry).

You can build the external libraries and add binary file dependencies yourself, but for simplicity, they are available in this repository.

Prior to building CSPro, look at your project's [BUILD.md](https://github.com/csprousers/cspro/blob/dev/BUILD.md). A tag will identify which set of external libraries should be used for that build.

The CSPro source code is available here: <https://github.com/csprousers/cspro>.
